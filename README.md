# Get-to-Know-Wine
A supporting material of a [medium](https://medium.com/) post <b>["A 'Non-Subjective' Guide to Wine"](https://medium.com/@aryaindratanaya/a-non-subjective-guide-to-wine-b98a61df4b0c)</b>.

## Installation
I recommend the creation of a virtual environment before installing the necessary libraries. This project requires <b>Pandas</b> and <b>Matplotlib</b> libraries. To ease the installation process, the following command can be used.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested to learn about wine while and the basics to extract insights from data. The insights can be reflected as the answers to these questions:
1. What are the varieties of wine? or at least, what are the most popular wine varieties?
2. Knowing the popular wine varieties, Which one should we pick?
3. Are the popular wines the best wines?

## File Descriptions
The main file of this project is `GetToKnowWine.ipynb` and the dataset is stored in `winemag-data-130k-v2.csv`. This project uses the [Wine Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) dataset that is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Findings
Comments are given in most parts of `GetToKnowWine.ipynb` to show the context and findings. However, the more detailed findings are given in the <b>["A 'Non-Subjective' Guide to Wine"](https://medium.com/@aryaindratanaya/a-non-subjective-guide-to-wine-b98a61df4b0c)</b>.
